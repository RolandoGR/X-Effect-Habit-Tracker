# X-Effect-Habit-Tracker
The X-Effect Habit Tracker is a web application designed to help users build and maintain positive habits through a visual and interactive interface. Based on the "Don't Break the Chain" method, this tool uses a 7x7 grid allowing users to visually track their progress and stay motivated by marking an "X" on each day a habit is completed.
